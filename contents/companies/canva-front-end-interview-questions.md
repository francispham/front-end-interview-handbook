**17th June 2025**:

> The problem presented for the AI-assisted coding interviews was one of the problems I practiced: "Create a production-grade Figma clone". I got lost discussing requirements, couldn't figure out what the interviewer wanted, they kept asking what I thought the scope should be. Built a canvas with drag-drop rectangles.

**8th June 2025**:

> Had a weird interview experience with Canva for Senior Frontend Role, for system design they sent me a list of example questions (build Netflix, uber, google docs etc) and heaps of study links, then when it came down to the system design interview it was like a weird pop quiz about what client side tech to use when scaling an SPA, also questions like what is SPA what are the alternatives, the the questions were all straight forward and I felt I have good answers but I was so tilted by this weird format after spending weeks practicing system design white boarding

> Then similar thing happened with the language proficiency round, was given a list of topics to prepare; dom mutations, event handling, async & core JavaScript fundamentals, they even sent me a starter pack html/css/js files, so I practiced building little apps in vanilla js very confident, then when it came to the interview.. ok let’s build an in memory comment service in TypeScript.. I got completely tilted, didn’t have a typescript env configured, decided to do it in pure js but failed as I got hung up on the data structure the interviewer was suggesting

**24th Oct 2024**:

> I did one two years ago but now the recruiter says they're doing leetcode/hackerank style for the first round, this is for staff level.
